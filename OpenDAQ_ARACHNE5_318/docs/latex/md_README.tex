{\bfseries Overview\-:} This firmware is designed to be easily edited to add, remove, and change the order of inputs.\par
All the standard input blocks are in the file \hyperlink{inputs_8c}{inputs.\-c} \par
With minimal programming experience, other sensors with different protocols may be added as well, by creating a new input block and adding it to \hyperlink{inputs_8c}{inputs.\-c} \par
